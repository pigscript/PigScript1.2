pigscript 1.2
Please help me improve the code!
My email: pigscript@gmail.com

Tested work on windows 7 & 8 on chrome browser.
Screen resolution may matter, so draw a small test picture first.
New feature: now you can preview the output image and control its color accuracy.

How to draw:
	1. Switch to drawball.com, enable full screen, and choose the pen size.
	2. Run the code or the .exe file.
	3. Follow the instructions on the command line.
	
Caution:
	1. Don't let the command window block the color wheel.
	2. If the image is large(>600*600), it may take several seconds to load.
	3. If the image is too large or too complicated(has more than 8 major colors), it may take very long to draw.
	4. If your screen resolution is not 1280*800 or 1366*768, you need to help the program to locate the big ball and the color wheel.
